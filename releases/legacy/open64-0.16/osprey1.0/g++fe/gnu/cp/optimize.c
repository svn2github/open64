   o In order to make inlining-on-trees work, we pessimized
     function-local static constants.  In particular, they are now
     always output, even when not addressed.  Fix this by treating
     function-local static constants just like global static
     constants; the back-end already knows not to output them if they
     are not needed.
     
   o Provide heuristics to clamp inlining of recursive template
     calls?  */
