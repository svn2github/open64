/* Stategy: 

   This garbage-collecting allocator allocates objects on one of a set
   of pages.  Each page can allocate objects of a single size only;
   available sizes are powers of two starting at four bytes.  The size
   of an allocation request is rounded up to the next power of two
   (`order'), and satisfied from the appropriate page.

   Each page is recorded in a page-entry, which also maintains an
   in-use bitmap of object positions on the page.  This allows the
   allocation state of a particular object to be flipped without
   touching the page itself.

   Each page-entry also has a context depth, which is used to track
   pushing and popping of allocation contexts.  Only objects allocated
   in the current (highest-numbered) context may be collected.  

   Page entries are arranged in an array of singly-linked lists.  The
   array is indexed by the allocation size, in bits, of the pages on
   it; i.e. all pages on a list allocate objects of the same size.
   Pages are ordered on the list such that all non-full pages precede
   all full pages, with non-full pages arranged in order of decreasing
   context depth.

   Empty pages (of all orders) are kept on a single page cache list,
   and are considered first when new pages are required; they are
   deallocated at the start of the next collection if they haven't
   been recycled by then.  */
