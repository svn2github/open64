KernelCompile

We use a shell scripts file to handle options for kernel compilation.
It locates in kpro64/targia64_ia64_nodebug/driver/

Scripts file kdriver mainly does these things:
1)ignores these options onlyfor GCC and do not pass them to opencc.
  For options such as omit_frame-pointer that gcc uses for kernel
  compilation, but are not relavant to osprey. So we must ignore them.
2)Create and pass correct options such as -OPT:spec=off and -OPT:swp=off
  for osprey.

First, it gets all the gcc options for kernel compilation (We do not
need to modify kernel's makefile). Then it adds essential ospry options
and ignores some options only supported by gcc. Builds and passes
correct options to osprey for kernel compilation.

I'd like to add it as a seperate file. It is just for kernel building.
For other application, we still use the origional driver.

When we build kernel, we use it like this:

  make CC=kopencc (kopencc=kdriver, just a symbol link)

then, it will help us to reorgnize the options.
That's the way we use it now.
Good luck and enjoy it.
