Introduction:

     The Open64 Eclipse Compiler plugin is designed to facilitate
the compilation of C, C++, and Fortran projects inside of Eclipse. 
Additionally it contains many compiler flags and will parse error
output.



Dependences:

    1. Eclipse 3.2.x Installation. The Open64 plugin does not yet 
       work with Eclipse Europa (3.3)

    2. Eclipse CDT 3.1.x  Download from http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/

    3. Eclipse Photran. Download from http://www.eclipse.org/photran/

    4. Open64 - Any version. This should be installed on your 
       local system and accessable from command line.

    Note: Photran offers "Full Versions" of Eclipse from their 
    downloads page. These versions already have dependeces 1-3 
    installed.



Installation Instructions:

    To install the plugin, click and download either the source
or the binary version. Move the downloaded file into your main 
Eclipse directory (the directory containing the eclipse executable).
Unzip the file: >$  tar -xvzf org.eclipse.open64-1.0.0.tar.gz 
Start Eclipse with the -clean flag.
