/* ====================================================================
 * ====================================================================
 *
 * Module: config_purple.h
 * $Revision$
 * $Date$
 * $Author$
 * $Source$
 *
 * Revision history:
 *  25-Mar-97 - Original Version
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * Define the external interface to the internal flags representing the
 * -PURPLE group options.  It is a single struct, so that addition of
 * flags for new options does not require additions to the be Exported
 * file.  Since these options do not change on a per region basis,
 * there is no need for push/pop operations like other groups (such
 * as -LNO) support.
 *
 * NOTE:  Only the standard group option reader, and routines in the
 * associated file config_purple.c, should modify the structs declared
 * here.  By following this discipline, leaving a few undefined flags
 * at the end of the struct, and adding new flags there, we can avoid 
 * serious version incompatibilities between be.so and its clients.
 *
 * ====================================================================
 *
 * To add a new option:
 *
 * (On conversion from the old PURPLE implementation, I tried to use
 * naming which was mostly like what had been used before, but
 * consistent.  The instructions below reflect the results.)
 *
 *   1) In the PURPLE_FLAGS options struct defined below, add a field to
 *	receive the new option value.  If you need a flag indicating
 *	whether the option was set explicitly on the command line, add
 *	a BOOL for that as well, with an appended "_set" in its name.
 *	(You might also need another field if the option will be used
 *	in a different form after configuration, i.e. the option value
 *	is a string that is converted to a number.  If so, add another
 *	field.)
 *
 *	The fields are starting out in alphabetical order by option
 *	name.  When adding new ones, keep in mind that adding them in
 *	the middle will create a required correspondence between the
 *	new be.so and lno.so (for purposes of using the later options).
 *	That may be alright, but if you want to avoid it, add the new
 *	fields just before the buffer at the end (and you can move
 *	them into place later when it doesn't matter, if you care).
 *
 *   2) Below the PURPLE_FLAGS definition are #defines for the
 *	"PURPLE_Option_Name" pseudo-variables that everyone will use to
 *	reference them.  Add #defines for your new ones.  Note that
 *	they all have PURPLE_ prefixes.
 *
 *   3) There is only one instances of PURPLE_FLAGS in config_purple.c.
 *	We do not support pushing/popping of flag values based on
 *      region boundaries (will we ever want to?).
 *
 *   4) The option group descriptor is also in config_purple.c.  Add your
 *	new option there.
