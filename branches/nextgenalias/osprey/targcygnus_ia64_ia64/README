This is an introduction to building the cygnus tools for ia32->ia64.

1: ensure that the *tex* rpm's are installed on the build machine.

   To get the RH6.0 RPMs on line use something like the following
	mount google.engr:/xlv2/PC/Linux/  /mnt/google
	cd /mnt/google/Redhat-6.0/i386/RedHat/RPMS
	rpm -i <the things you want>
	unmount /mnt/google

2: ensure that /usr/ia64-sgi-linux/bin is in your $PATH

3: If you build gdb (and maybe for other things too)
you may see
> ../../cygnus_19990722/gdb/ia64-tdep.c:33: targ_isa_subset.h: No such file or directory
[and other messages of the like]

Check to see if /usr/sgi/include/ has the needed files on the
machine your using.  If not install sgi_targinfo-0.01.0-1.i386.rpm
and sgi_targinfo_devel-0.01.0-1.i386.rpm 

Those RPMs are to be found in places like
/usr2/4DTEST/osprey10i_rpm/<release stamp> on merlin2.engr
As of the time this is being written
59453_Oct14 is the latest <release stamp> directory for these RPMs.
