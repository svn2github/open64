Making rpm package for Open64 compiler.

Directory Layout for making the rpm package:
<RPM-PACKAGE>/
  BUILD/   ( temporary for building the compiler, not used yet )
  root/    ( contains all open64 stuffs without symbol links )
  RPMS/    ( contains the final rpm package )
  SOURCES/ ( contains the source of the compiler, not used yet )
  SPECS/   ( contains the spec file for rpm package )
  SRPMS/   ( contains  the final source rppm package, not used yet )

To tell rpm-build to use the <RPM-PACKAGE> as the TOP DIR, please add this line below to $HOME/.rpmmacros. 
If $HOME/.rpmmacros does not exist, please create it. Replace <RPM-PACKAGE> with the actual path.

%_topdir <RPM-PACKAGE>

Steps for making the rpm package:

1. Build and install the compiler by hand
2. Copy all stuffs into root/, excluding the symbol links and GCC stuffs.
   - directory layout in root/
     root/
       opt/
         open64/
           bin/
           lib/
   - symbol links include ipl, whirl2c_be and whirl2f_be, ...
   - GCC stuffs include crt*.o, libgcc.*, libstdc++*, ...
3. Change the directory to <RPM-PACKAGE> and run mkrpm.sh
4. The final rpm package is in RPMS/$ARCH/
