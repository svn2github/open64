Download Package: &nbsp; <a href=LaTeX-indextools.tar.gz>LaTeX-indextools.tar.gz</a>
<p>

Example Usage: &nbsp; see the directory <code>example/</code>.
<p>

<p>
Purpose:  &nbsp; 
Provide simple tools to select, insert, and remove index entries
from/to LaTeX source files.
</p>

<p>
Limitations:  &nbsp; 
Any existing index entries must reside at the beginning of a line
and terminate with a percent character:
<pre>
     \index{...}%
</pre>
No other LaTeX source should appear on the line.  The index entry
must be followed by either (a) another index entry or (b) the word
being indexed.  The indexed word should be at the beggining of
the line the follows the last index entry for that word.
The text of the index entry can be as complicated
as you wish -- within the limitations of LaTeX.
<p>

See Lamport's LaTeX User Guide, Appendix A.
<p>

RECOMMENDED USAGE:
<p>

Back up your source files before running any of the following programs.
<p>

The program
<pre>
     indexselect.pl
</pre>
will examine the files listed in indexfiles.txt and create a verbose
list of possible words to index.  The output is sent to indexcandidates.txt.
The user can manually trim this list to file indexwords.txt for the
next processing step.  The program will not generate output for occurrences
of words in \index{...} directives that begin a line.
<p>

The program
<pre>
     indexinsert.pl
</pre>
will use the file indexwords.txt to "markup" the text in each of the
files listed in indexfiles.txt.  The entries are created in the
simple form
<pre>
     \index{something}%
</pre>
as the only entry on a line which comes directly before either
(a) another index entry or (b) the word being indexed. The indexed word
will be at the beggining of the line the follows the last index entry
for that word.  The index entries can then be hand-edited for
index formatting, etc. (See Lamport's LaTeX User Guide, Appendix A).
The indexinsert algorithm will not alter a line of your source code
unless an "indexed" word appears in the line.  In this latter case,
the line will probably be split and any contiguous sequences of white
space will be reduced to 1 space character.  This might affect verbatim
environments which contain indexed words.
<p>

The program
<pre>
     indexremove.pl
</pre>
will remove all single-line index entries from the files in indexfiles.txt
and place them in indexstripped.txt.  The indexstripped.txt file is
formatted as follows:
<pre>
     filename indexedword \index{...}
</pre>
where the "indexedword" is the first white-space delimited word that
begins the line following a sequence of one or more \index{...} directives.
