1. Overview
===========

 This is version 4.2.4 of the x86 Open64 compiler suite.

 x86 Open64 is an open source, optimizing compiler for 32-bit (x86) and
 64-bit (x86-64) achitectures. x86 Open64 supports Fortran 77/90/95, C (C89
 and C99 with GNU extensions), and C++ (C++98 with GNU extensions), as well as
 the shared memory programming model OpenMP (version 2.5).

 The compiler source code and instrumentation library (libinstr) are released
 under GPL v2. Libraries intended for redistribution are licensed under
 LGPL v2.1. These libraries include libffio, libfortran, libhugetlbfs, libmv,
 libopen64rt, libopen64rt_shared, libacml_mv, and libopenmp.



2. New Features in x86 Open64 4.2.4
===================================

 o [TBD]



3. The Packages of the Compiler Suite
=====================================

 This compiler is available in both binary and source-code forms.

 o x86_open64-4.2.4-1.src.tar.bz2

   This package contains the compiler's source code. To unpack the source, use
   the command:

     tar xjvf x86_open64-4.2.4-1.src.tar.bz2

   For instructions on how to build the compiler from source, see the included
   INSTALL file.

 o x86_open64-4.2.4-1.x86_64.tar.bz2

   This package contains the binary code for x86-64 machines.

   The compiler is built on an x86-64-based system running SUSE Linux
   Enterprise Server (SLES) 10 with SP2 installed. We use the system
   compilers (GCC 4.1.2) to build the compiler components and a prebuilt
   binary release of the x86 Open64 compiler, version 4.2.3.2, to build the
   libraries. The x86 Open64 4.2.3.2 release can be downloaded from
   http://developer.amd.com/cpu/open64.

 o x86_open64-4.2.4-1.x86_64.rpm

   This package contains the same binaries as the tar.bz2 package in RPM form.



4. Supported Operating Systems
==============================

 The two binary packages,

 o x86_open64-4.2.4-1.x86_64.tar.bz2
 o x86_open64-4.2.4-1.x86_64.rpm

 are tested and validated on 64-bit Linux systems running:

 o SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 10 with SP2
 o SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 11
 o Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.3
 o Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.4

 x86 Open64 compilers make use of the GNU binutils package.
 Packages known to work include:

 o binutils-2.16.91.0.5-23.31 (SLES 10 with SP2)
 o binutils-2.19-11.28 (SLES 11)
 o binutils-2.17.50.0.6-9.el5 (RHEL 5.3)
 o binutils-2.17.50.0.6-12.el5 (RHEL 5.4)


5. Installing the Compiler Suite
================================

5.1 Install from bz2 Package
----------------------------

 To install the compiler from the bz2 package:

 o Expand x86_open64-4.2.4-1.x86_64.tar.bz2 with the command:

   tar xjvf x86_open64-4.2.4-1.x86_64.tar.bz2

 o If desired, move the x86_open64-4.2.4 directory to the final
   installation location using the 'mv' command.

   The C, C++, FORTRAN compilers are now available in the 'bin'
   subdirectory.


5.2 Install from RPM Package
----------------------------

 Normally you must have superuser privileges to install RPM packages.

 To install the compiler from RPM:

 $ rpm -ivh x86_open64-4.2.4-1.x86_64.rpm

 This command will install the x86 Open64 compiler to
 /opt/x86_open64-4.2.4.2. The C, C++, FORTRAN compilers are in folder
 /opt/x86_open64-4.2.4/bin.

 To install the compiler to another location:

 $ rpm --prefix=/path/to/folder -ivh x86_open64-4.2.4-1.x86_64.rpm

 Then the compiler will be installed to /path/to/folder.



6. Bug Reporting and Support
============================

 To report a bug or get help with the binary releases, please see the Support
 section on http://developer.amd.com/cpu/open64.

 Bug reports should include these items in order to be reproduced:

 o The compiler release version.

 o System details -- the OS, libc version, etc.

 o The compilation flags that trigger the bug.

 o The test file if applicable (it is highly appreciated if the test file is
   minimized).

 o The correct output of the test file.



7. Known Issues and Limitations
===============================

 o Linux Operating Systems are frequently configured with a soft limit on
   process stack sizes. Programs that exceed these limits by methods such as
   placing very large arrays on the stack will terminate with a segmentation
   violation. You can query and alter these limits using the ulimit command
   (ksh, sh and bash) or limit command (tcsh, csh).

 o Open64 does not support the following GCC extensions:
   - complex integer data types
   - decimal floating point types
   - GCC vector types containing a single element
   - GCC vector types whose base type is char and whose overall size is less
     than 8 bytes
   - the __builtin_object_size function
   - the __builtin_apply function
   - vector types other than MMX (8-byte) and SSE (16-bit)

   The __builtin_return_address function is supported only with no
   optimization.  The 'long double' implementation is not compatible with GCC.

 o Open64 does not fully support C99 variable length arrays.

 o To provide the best runtime performance, the compiler makes assumptions that
   runtime integer arithmetic expressions that arise in certain contexts do not
   overflow (that is, they do not produce values that are too high or too low
   to represent).  These assumptions apply to expressions that are present in
   user code as well as expressions that the compiler constructs.  Note that if
   an integer arithmetic overflow assumption is violated, runtime behavior is
   undefined.

   Option '-OPT:wrap_around_unsafe=off' instructs the compiler to be
   conservative about integer overflow assumptions and avoid performing
   optimizations that are based on integer overflow assumptions, for example,
   linear function test replacement.
