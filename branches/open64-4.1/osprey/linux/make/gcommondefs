#ident "$Revision: 1.1.1.1 $"
# 
# This file has been heavily hacked for building on Linux
#
# Common makefile definitions.
#
# Notes:
#   - Definitions with the same names only need to be passed on the
#     command line of recursive makes if they would be redefined by
#     the sub-makefile.  Definitions passed on the command line are
#     not reset by the environment or the definitions in the makefile.
#   - C++ style macros are deprecated and will be removed when out of use.
#     They must be interwoven in definitions to keep upward compatibility.
#
#   - The contents of this header are changed based on some variables
#     should be defined BEFORE including this file:
#     OBJECT_STYLE - define basic ABI/ISA that should be used to create product.
#	this also sets LD search paths, C/C++/Fortran/Pascal options.
#     NO_OBJECT_STYLE - disable all this new OBJECT_STYLE business.
#	Note that if one does this all the info in releasedefs about
#	compiler versions, default compilation modes etc will be ignored.
#	Only smake-files can do this.
#     NO_LSRCH - do not set any library searching rules for LD options.
#     ASTYLE  - by default, the ABI/ISA for C is used for assembler -
#	setting ASTYLE (to be assembler options) can override the OBJECT_STYLE
#	to permit fine-tuning of asm code.
#     NO_STARTOPT - don't set any of the DSO start option macros - this
#	will keep the global so_locations files from being updated.
