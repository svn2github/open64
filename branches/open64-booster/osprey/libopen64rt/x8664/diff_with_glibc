# of a clone of the glibc GIT tree: git://sources.redhat.com/git/glibc.git
# 
# Note that the file config.h is generated by the configuration process:
# cd <PATH_TO_TREE>
# mkdir b
# cd b
# <PATH_TO_TREE>/b/configure --prefix=$PWD/local && make && make install
#
# Note that configure phase is only needed to build config.h, though running
# subsequent make phases are useful for testing.
