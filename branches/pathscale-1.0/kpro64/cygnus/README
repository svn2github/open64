ADDENDUM:
	The timestamp has been removed from the directory name.  The
cygnus_20000828 directory referenced above existed in the Pro64 sources and
has been renamed to cygnus prior to importing PathScale 1.0. The PathScale
sources contained cygnus_20030612, but that directory got renamed to cygnus
prior to the import as well.
