To build dwarfdump, first build libdwarf in the neighboring
directory then type
	./configure
	make

To use dwarf or libdwarf, you may want to install dwarf.h and
libdwarf.h somewhere convenient, and you may need the libdwarf
in the accompanying libdwarf directory

If your headers or libelf/libdwarf are not in the expected places,
use the configure script to access them (and to add other ld
or C flags).
For example, using csh syntax:
	setenv PRIVATE_LIBDIR /home/davea/lib
	./configure LDFLAGS="-L$PRIVATE_LIBDIR" \
		CPPFLAGS="-I/home/davea/inc" CFLAGS="-I/home/davea/inc"
Set both CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS so that configure works properly.

If $PRIVATE_LIBDIR  has both libelf.so and libelf.a, the libelf.so
will be picked up and 
  "./tag_tree_build: error while loading shared libraries: 
	libelf.so.0: cannot open shared object file: 
	No such file or directory"
will probably result.
Either: remove libelf.so.* from your $PRIVATE_LIBDIR
or set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to $PRIVATE_LIBDIR, or use LDFLAGS to
set rpath.   Much simpler all around to ensure that $PRIVATE_LIBDIR
only has archive libelf, not shared-library libelf.
