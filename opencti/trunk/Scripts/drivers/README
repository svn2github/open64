This directory currently contains test-level and unit-level drivers,
e.g. scripts referred to in the TEST_DRIVER and UNIT_DRIVER control
variables within CTI options files and tmconfig files.

Design notes for those making changes:

1) Please use /usr/local/bin/perl for the time being for all new Perl
driver scripts. This is a temporary measure; at some point we will
have an official "approved" copy of Perl for CTI.  Make sure you use
the "-w" flag!

2) If you are writing Perl code that you think might be used by more
than one driver, please place the code into a module and put it in the
"lib" subdirectory. For library code, make sure you following the
existing conventions for modules. If you do choose to include "lib"
modules, make sure that your top-level driver implements the
"main::error" and "main::warning" functions, since these functions
are called by the library code.
