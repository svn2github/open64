<br>
  A CTI schedule file is a collection of perl test objects which can be used to run daily CTI tests and generate web report results. The format of this data is as following:

<pre><code>TestInfo->new(
    VIEW        => "your_test_view",
    DAYS        => [the_weekly_days_to_run_this_test],            # ex.: ['mon', 'wed', 'fri']
    MACHINE     => "the_host_from_where_the_tests_are_launched",
    DISTRIBUTED => to_use_or_not_dTM,                             # 1 = use dTM
    OPTIONS     => "/the/option/file",
    ACTIONS     => "additional_options_passed_to_TM_command",
    WORKDIR     => "/the/work/directory",
    LOGNAME     => "/the/log/file",
    KEY         => "key_selection",                               # see "tm-schedule -help"
);
</code></pre>

<br>
  Everything in a schedule file should follow Perl language syntax. The file will be read in with a perl 'do' statement and will abort if any perl error syntax occur.
In order to setup a schedule file a user doesn't have to, necessary, knows the Perl language syntax itself, the format is pretty straightforward for someone accustomed to any scripting language and a peek in somebody else's schedule file can help a lot.

<br>
Once such a schedule file is defined a user can validate it and launch all the specified tests using '${CTI_HOME}/bin/tm-schedule.pl' script, see the usage message.<br>
Example of a tm-schedule invocation:
<pre><code>${CONFIGURE_ctihome}/bin/tm-schedule.pl -no_match -s {CONFIGURE_ctihome}/cti_regression/cti_regression.sched -run
</code></pre>

<br>
To access the first layer of web reports use 'show-schedule' and 'show-failures' CGI scripts as following:
<pre><code>http://{CONFIGURE_webserver}/{CONFIGURE_webroot}/cgi-bin/show-schedule.cgi?sched={CONFIGURE_ctihome}/cti_regression/cti_regression.sched
http://{CONFIGURE_webserver}/{CONFIGURE_webroot}/cgi-bin/show-failures.cgi?sched={CONFIGURE_ctihome}/cti_regression/cti_regression.sched
</code></pre>

<br>
<br>
Additionally the schedule file can be used to customize some settings for 'show-schedule' and 'show-failures' reports as following:
<ul>
 <li>use '%SCHED_Menu' hash table to customize the top menu for the web reports</li>
 <li>use '$SCHED_known_failures' variable to render, by default, the known failures column on 'show-failures' page;</li>
 <li>use '$SCHED_Cache_dir' variable to specify a different than default cache directory</li>
</ul>
