<a NAME="CmdLineKill"></a>

<h1>How do I cancel submitted jobs?</h1>
<p>
This can be done either via the command line or the CTI web. Each task submitted to
the dTM server is assigned a group id and a task id.  The individual task and 
the group as a whole can be canceled, with dtm -cancel command:
<ol>
</p>
<p>
<pre><code> %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -cancel  &lt;group #&gt;:&lt;task #&gt;

Examples:
1) kill a task
  %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -cancel 183:14
2) kill a group
  %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -cancel 183:-1
</code></pre>
</p><p>
</ol>
Note that using a task id -1 will kill a group (i.e. all tasks within the
specified group).  The group and task id's can be found:
<ol>
<li>On the "Machine Pool" page for a given test pool.
All currently running jobs are displayed next to the machine they are
running on.
The group and task ids are indicated for each job in the first line
"groupid:taskid user"

In the above web page examples, task boxes and group boxes contain a cancel! button in it. Clicking on it will kill the task
or the group immediately. Note that since a group contains many individual tasks, it may take a little bit longer to cancel.
You may need to reload the web page many time to see the result of killing a group.<br>

<a NAME="CmdEnable"></a>

<h1>How do I enable/disable a machine in a dTM pool?</h1>
When a machine is disabled, it prevents dTM server from allocating any dTM jobs on it. This is 
useful for cases where you need exclusive use of a particular machine or a machine behaviors
bedly and needs a reboot. The disable and enable can be done via the command line or via the web page.
The formats of commands are:
<ul>
<pre><code> %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -enable &lt;host_name&gt; 
 %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -disable &lt;host_name&gt; -info="strings"

Examples:
1) disable host_name
  %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -disable host_name -info="My experiment"
2) enable host_name
  %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -enable host_name
</code></pre>
</ul>
You need to provide some information for disable as to why you disable it.
Note that the above commands affect only the foreground server. If you want to send 
the command to the background server, use -bg option (though this is not encouraged to do so)
<ul>
   <pre><code> %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -bg -enable &lt;host_name&gt; 
 %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -bg -disable &lt;host_name&gt; -info="strings"
</code></pre>
</ul>
But you can't see the effect of the command via the web, because the web page only displays the status of foreground server.

<hr WIDTH="100%">

<a NAME="AllEnable"></a>
<h1>How do I enable/disable all machines in all pools?</h1>
<pre><code> perl -ne 'print "%DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm -enable=$1\n" if m|&lt;host&gt;(.+?)&lt;|' %DTM_HOME%/conf/dTM_conf.xml |sort -u | ksh
</code></pre>
<hr WIDTH="100%">


<h1><a NAME="Relocate"></a>

<h1>How do I put running jobs back to pending list to be rescheduled?</h1>
If a test is running for a very long time and you suspect that it may be hanging (due to process issue or a test case
running into a infinite loop), you may want to stop its running and put it back to the pending list and have CTI 
reallocate it to another machine to give another try. You can do so with the following dTM reschedule command:

<ol>
<pre><code>   %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -resched   &lt;group #&gt;:&lt;task #&gt;</code></pre>
</ol>
Note that the task to be rescheduled must be running. For example:
<ol>
<pre><code>   %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -resched 3245:5 </code></pre>
</ol>
will reschedule task 5 of group 3245.
<hr WIDTH="100%">


<a NAME="EnvVar"></a>

<h1>Can I control which machines my jobs are launched on?</h1>
Yes.  Here is a list of environment variables
that you may place in your TM options file to have fine tuned job
control
<ul>
<li>DTM_CPUARCH - specify CPU architecture</li>
<li>DTM_OPSYS - Linux_SLES_11</li>
<li>DTM_CPUIMPL - specify implementation</li>
<li>DTM_CPUFREQ - minimum desired cpu frequency</li>
<li>DTM_MINCPUS - minimum desired number of cpus</li>
<li>DTM_PRIORITY - jobs are scheduled to launch based on their priorities. If you
do not set DTM_PRIORITY, the default value is 2. A value in range 1 through 8999 
is a relative priority, meaning that your task with a higher relative priority will
only put off your own tasks with lower relative priorities.

A value in a range from 9000 to 10000 is a absolute priority. A task with highest 
absolute priority in the dTM server will get machine resource first if there are
machines available for the task.

</li>
<li>DTM_POOL - names of test pools and/or machines to be used for running jobs. The 
format of valid string is </li>

<pre><code>  DTM_POOL=[Pool[,Pool]*][:Mach[,Mach]*][/[Pool[,Pool]*][:Mach[,Mach]*]]
  where
    Pool=poolname[#threshold]
    Mach=machinename[#threshold]
    Meta Symbols    [ ] *
    Delimiters      : / # ,

</code></pre>

The pools and machines prior to "/" are primary pools, the ones after it are
secondary pools. While the primary pool is required, the secondary pool is
optional. The threshold values for primary pools and machines are ignored.

<pre><code>Examples:
  DTM_POOL=Default
    - use only Default machine pool as primary pool.
  DTM_POOL=Default,Special
    - use both Special and Default pool machines as primary pool.
  DTM_POOL=Default/Special#30,Build#30
    - use the Default machine as primary pool. When the primary pool is busy
      and one of the secondary pool (Special or Build) machines has
      more than 30% of CPU idle time, use the machine.
  DTM_POOL=Special:host02,host03
    - use host02 and host03 in Special pool as primary pool
  DTM_POOL=Default/Build:build13#50,build21#30,build22#30
    - use Default as primary pool and build13, build21 and build22 in the
      Build pool as secondary pool. Note that build13, build21 and build22
      have different thresholds. 
  DTM_POOL=:host01,host02,host03
    - use machine host01, host02 and host03 as primary pool, reguardless of
      where the machines come from.
  DTM_POOL=Special,Default:host01,host02,host03
    - use machine host01, host02 and host03, from either Special or Default
      pools, as primary pool.
</code></pre>
An example using Special as primary pool and selected machines as secondary pool:
<pre><code> %CTI_HOME%/bin/TM.pl -d -f /path/to/Myoptions DTM_POOL=Special/:host01#30,build20#35
</code></pre>
</ul>
<p>
For secondary pools, it is recommanded to use 30 for Special and Default
pools and 35 for Build pool as a threshold value.
</p>

<hr WIDTH="100%">


<a NAME="SharePool"></a>
<h1>What are the guidelines for using sharing pools and absolute priority?</h1>
<p>
Sharing pool policy: If your team has a dedicated pool, use
it as your primary pool and other pools as your secondary
pools if you want; otherwise use Default as a primary pool,
and pools other than Default as secondary pool.
</p>
<p>
Absolute priority policy: Use absolute priority on exception
basis. For example, in urgent need of test result, or doing
development at night. But don't send too many absolute priority
TM runs at a time.
</p>

<hr WIDTH="100%">

<a NAME="Priority"></a>
<h1>What are absolute and relative priorities and why do we need them?</h1>
<p>
The valid range for DTM_PRIORITY is from 1 to 10000. The higher part
(9000 - 10000) is absolute priority and the lower (1 - 8999) relative priority.
When the dTM allocates machines, a task with a highest absolute priority
will get a machine first and absolute priority tasks will get machines
before relative priority tasks. The tasks with the same absolute priority
will be on a first in first serve basis. While absolute priority give your
task ability to run before others, it does not make a fair use of CPU cycles.
</p>
<p>
Suppose we only have absolute priority in dTM, if you want to prioritize 
your two runs with different priorities, your higher one may put off
not only your lower run but also some other peoples tasks. This is
what we are trying to prevent with relative priority. In short, relative priority
allows a user to prioritize  his/her own test runs without affecting
other's tasks in term of CPU usage. However this is not true
for performance pool. A priority is absolute all the time for performance 
machines. Note that the dTM server applys the same DTM_PRIORITY setting to both 
performance and non-performance pools.
</p>

<hr WIDTH="100%">

<a NAME="ProcessError"></a>
<h1>What would I do when I get a PROCESS ERROR in the log file?</h1>
<p>
When a test unit is allocated on a machine, the dTM launches it with a new process and
redirects the standard output
and standard error of the process to a file, named result.UID. After the unit
finishes, the TM checks if the file exists. If not, we definitely have a PROCESS ERROR.
It is hard for dTM server to figure out what is causing the process error.
It may be due to machine issues, clearcase, networks and NFS problems, OS gliches, Java
or TM/dTM bugs.
</p>
<p>
The current implementation of TM/dTM does not help diagnose the root cause of abmornal
process problems. Instead the dTM/TM does something defensive:
report the problem and take only actions to make sure that the server itself is still
in a healthy state and continues to accept tasks from users. The future development of
TM/dTM may go further by taking aggressive actions.
</p>
<p>
With this said, if you get a process error from a test run, you have to diagnose it
yourself manually. How to do it? It is not hard fortunately: run
the following command from the dTM server:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
	ssh HOST %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm_runUTM.pl -id=GID:TID:UNIT -w=WORKDIR
</pre>
</p>
<p>
where HOST is the machine on which you will launch the unit;
GID and TID, representing group id and task id , are
assigned numbers for the unit, which should be any numbers greater than 0
for rerunning purpose. UNIT is partial pathname for the unit, such as
Regression/.../sched. WORKDIR is the test's work directory full
pathname.
</p>
<p>
This is the exact command that dTM uses to launch a test unit.
For a local run,  you can simply log onto
the local machine and start your rerun with dtm_runUTM. You may modify the
TMEnv file under the work directory to add, remove or change one or more environment
variable settings, before the unit rerun.
</p>

<hr WIDTH="100%">

<a NAME="GetLock"></a>
<h1>How do I get a performance machine lock manually?</h1>
<p>
The dTM server is capable of managing the performance locks for your dTM tasks.
You do not have to do anything special to get this functionality, even when doing
a rerun. However occasionally
you may want to grab a performance machine to do something other than TM tasks,
such as installing software, or updating certain PBO data stored on
the machine. You can do this in one of two ways. One is to disable a performance
machine, like you would do to a non-performance machine. The other is to request 
a lock on the machine with the getlock command. When the machine is allocated to
you, log onto it and do your job there. When you finish your job, release the
lock using the releaselock command. The usage of the getlock command follows:
<ol>
<pre><code>
  %DTM_HOME%/bin/getlock.pl &lt;machine_list&gt; -locktime=&lt;minutes&gt; [-waittime=&lt;minutes&gt;] [-priority=&lt;number&gt;] [-info=&lt;strings&gt;] [-reserve]
Description:
       Request dTM server to get a performance machine lock from the specified
       machine list. The dTM server will put the request in the performance task queue.
       When one of the requested machines is available, the dTM server allocates the
       machine to this task by outputting the host name to standard output. If an
       interactive user specifys -reserve option, it will send the allocated host
       name via email.
Options:
  &lt;machine_list&gt; - a list of performance machine host names delimited by a comma;
                   or a file which contains a list of performance machine host names
                   delimited by spaces or commas. This is a required argument.
  -locktime=&lt;minutes&gt; - how long a task holds a machine lock. If its value is non-zero,
                   when the time a user holds a lock exceeds the value, the dTM server
                   will force the lock to be released. For interactive users, this option
                   is required.
  -waittime=&lt;minutes&gt; - how long to wait in the performance queue to get a lock.
                   If its value is non-zero, when the waittime times out, the dTM server will
                   force the task to be removed from the queue and send a "FAIL" to the getlock
                   command or an email for a user task.
  -priority=&lt;number&gt; - the task priority. The performance task queue is ordered by
                   task priority. For a dTM job, its priority is decided by the setting
                   in DTM_PRIORITY. Default to 2.
  -info=&lt;strings&gt; -  information displayed on the web page. For dTM or rerun jobs, you
                   don't have to specify it. For other job, it is required.
  -reserve      -  the command put your request to the dTM performance queue and return
                   immediately. You are going to be notified with an email when a
                   machine is allocated to you. This option only works for interactive
                   use.
Example:
  %DTM_HOME%/bin/getlock.pl host1 -priority=2000 -locktime=20 -info="updating PBO data"
</code></pre>
</ol>
After you issue the command in the above example, you'll be notified via email
when a machine is allocated to you.
</p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">


<a NAME="SetLocktime"></a>
<h1>How do I set up 'locktime' and 'waittime' for my performance dTM jobs?</h1>
<p>
A performance task has two attributes in dTM: locktime and waittime. Locktime
indicates how long a task holds a machine lock. If the locktime of a task is 
non-zero, when the time the task holds a lock exceeds the locktime, the dTM server
will force the lock to be released. If the locktime is zero, dTM won't release the
lock until a releaselock command is issued on the machine.
</p>

<p>
Waittime indicates how long the task waits in the performance queue to get a lock.
If the value is non-zero, when the waittime times out, the dTM server will force the task to be
removed from the queue and send a "FAIL" to the getlock command and an email
the owner of the task. If the waittime is zero, the task will remain in the queue
until 1) the task is assigned a machine lock or 2) some one issues a "dtm.pl -perfcancel"
command to the task.
</p>

<p>
By default, the locktime and waittime are set to 0 in the getlock command. If you want
to set them, you need to use -locktime and -waittime options in the getlock command line
or export the following environment variables before issues the getlock:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<pre><code>   DTM_PERF_LOCKTIME
   DTM_PERF_WAITTIME
</code></pre>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The unit for these variables is minutes. For a dTM task, in the CTI default.conf file,
the locktime and waittime are set to 3 hours and 20 minutes (200 minutes) and fifteen hours
(900 minutes) respectively. Do not change these default setting until you really know what
you are doing, since it may impact other people's performance testing.
</p>
<p>
Example:
<ol>
<pre><code>  # 2 hours for locktime and 10 hours for waittime
%CTI_HOME%/bin/TM.pl -d -f /path/to/my_options DTM_PERF_LOCKTIME=120 DTM_PERF_WAITTIME=600
</code></pre>
</ol>
</p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">

<a NAME="ReleaseLock"></a>
<h1>How do I release a performance machine lock manually?</h1>
<p>
If you have manually grabbed a performance machine lock, release it with the following command
so that others can use the machine:
<ol>
	<pre><code> %DTM_HOME%/bin/releaselock.pl  &lt;performance_machine&gt;
</code></pre>
</ol>
Do not manually release a machine lock for a dTM or rerun task, until you are 100% sure
that the task being run has finished or has been killed.
</p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">

<a NAME="CancelPerfTask"></a>
<h1>How do I cancel a performance task in the performance task queue?</h1>
<p>
In general, you do not need to cancel a task in the performance task queue. It is managed
by the dTM server. But in case something goes wrong, and you need to do so, use the following command
<ol>
<pre><code> %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -perfcancel &lt;task #&gt;
</code></pre>
</ol>
Every performance task has a unique task id, which is displayed on the performance pool 
web page. 
You can't cancel a performance task that is running on on a performance machine. Instead,
if you are really sure that the task has finished, use the releaselock command to release the machine lock.
</p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">

<a NAME="ReRun"></a>
<h1>How do I rerun my performance test with a higher priority?</h1>
<p>
By default, a performance test rerun will use the default priority 2, even if the original run was
using some higher priority. If you want to rerun it and need it to be complete soon, raise
the priority. What you need to do is to edit the runhook.sh file with whatever editor you like;
search for 'getlock'; and add the option -priority=&lt;number_greater_than_2&gt; to the getlock
command line.
</p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">

<a NAME="LogFile"></a>

<h1>How do I tell if the server is hung or taking many errors, and needs to be restarted?</h1>
<p>
The server maintains 2 log files:
<li>server log: %DTM_HOME%/log/%DTM_SERVERLOG%</li>
<li>error log:  %DTM_HOME%/log/%DTM_ERRORLOG%</li>
Scan that file to see whether the server is making progress, or if many errors are being logged.
You can also look at the log file by clickng on <a href="%CTI_WEBHOME%/cgi-bin/get-file.cgi?file=%DTM_HOME%/log/%DTM_SERVERLOG%&last=200">Sever Log</a> and <a href="%CTI_WEBHOME%/cgi-bin/get-file.cgi?file=%DTM_HOME%/log/%DTM_ERRORLOG%&last=200">Error log</a> on the menu. 
It will display the last 200 lines of the log. If you want to see more lines, change the web script argument last=200.
</p>

<hr WIDTH="100%">


<a NAME="SoftKill"></a>

<h1>How do I restart dTM server without terminating current jobs?</h1>
When your TM command is running with dTM, it communicates the 
jobs with dTM server via a network connection between them. 
It is possible to shutdown the current server and
restart a new server without terminating the jobs (and connections) that have been submitted to
the currently running server.
<ol>
<li>The first step is to start the shutdown process of the current server.
This puts the server in a state where it will no longer accept jobs and it will
quit running as soon as all of the currently pending jobs have completed (it's called
<b>background server</b>). This is done via the command line <b>(as any user)</b> by entering:
<br>&nbsp;
<pre><code>  %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -stop
</code></pre>
<p>The dtm.pl -stop command will provide you, in the log file, with the current status
of the server being shutdown.  Here is a sample output in the log.  Once the
old server stops <font COLOR="green">accepting tasks</font>, one can proceed with step 2
and start the new server.
<pre><code>[10:17:24] Reading configuration...
[10:17:25] Attempting to connect to server...
[10:17:25] Connected to %DTM_SERVER%:%DTM_PORT%
</code></pre><font COLOR="green"><pre><code>[10:17:25] Server on %DTM_SERVER%:%DTM_PORT% is no longer accepting tasks.
</code></pre></font><pre><code>[10:17:25] Server on %DTM_SERVER%:%DTM_PORT% is accepting status queries only.
[10:18:25] Server on %DTM_SERVER%:%DTM_PORT% there are no more pending tasks.

</code></pre>
<p>If you want to know the machine status stored in the background server, type in
the command:
<pre><code>  %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -bg -dynamic </code></pre>

<li>The second step is to start the new server <b>(as %CTI_USER%)</b> on the server machine,
which is %DTM_SERVER%, by entering:
<br>
<pre><code> %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -start
</code></pre>

<p>The newly started server (<b>foreground server</b>) will take the machine
status from the background. So we don't have to worry about the
machine status, even if a machine was disabled automatically by the
background server before.
</ol>

<p>Note that when you start a server, if there is no background server running,
the machines state of non-performance test machine will be read from TestMachineState.log file
under the log directory and that of performance machines will be read from PerfMachineState.log file.
This would allow us to restore machines state easily from server machine crashes. 
But if this is the first time to start a server and the files do not exist,
all machines state will be set to disabled. In this case, you need to manually
enable all machines that you want to use, either via the dTM status web page or 
by invoking command
<ol>
<pre><code> %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -enable &lt;host_name&gt;
</code></pre>
</ol>

<h1>How do I kill and restart the server, when it is not responding or launching jobs?</h1>

When the dTM server is hanging, log on to the dTM server (as cti user) and see which java
processes are still running. For example,
<ol>
	<pre><code>
$ ps -ef | grep java | grep -v grep
 %CTI_USER% 26104     1  0  May  5  ?        151:35 %DTM_JAVAHOME%/bin/java %DTM_JAVAOPTIONS% -cp %DTM_HOME%/lib dTMServer -config=%DTM_HOME%/conf/dTM_conf.xml
</code></pre>
</ol>

If there is only one java process running, which must be the foreground server. We use the solution
to the above question to put the current server to the background and start a new one as a foreground
server. If there are two java processes running, meaning we already have both foreground and background
servers running, use unix "kill -9" to kill the one with the earlier start time, which must be background server;
then turn the foreground into background and restart a new server. 

After the new server restarts, cancel the groups or tasks on the background server (originally the
foreground server) and restart the tests with new server.
<br><br>
<b>If you are not able to turn the foreground server to background successfully, then we have a serious problem
with either dTM server or java VM. The only thing we can do is kill the java process, and restart a server.
Now try to access the web page again, enable the machines that was in a good state via the web page</li>
<p>

Note that killing dTM server will cause pending (queued but not issued)
dTM jobs to abort immediately. Any jobs that are already launched
at the time the server was killed continue to run. But the results can not
be recorded in the log file. Therefore it doesn't make sense to continue to run them.
The step 3 above is trying to kills all of them. Once the server
has been killed, all of the clients will proceed to generate a TM log file
based only on the tests that have completed yet. Pending jobs
and jobs currently running will be recoreded in the log file as missing test failures.

<hr WIDTH="100%">


<a NAME="NewMachine"></a>

<h1>How do I configure a new test machine?</h1>

Here is a list of things that you need to do in order to add a new machine
to the dTM pool. Some of these things are not strictly required for use
with dTM, but they make the machine a lot more usable for general development.
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
For a non-performance machine, create the /tmp/dTM directory on the machine.
This directory should be on a
file system that has one gigabyte of free space, hopefully more. If not, find a
disk that has at least a gigabyte of free space on the machine and
create a subdirectory named dTM on it and make /tmp/dTM a soft link to the
that directory. The new dTM directory ,and the soft link if any, has 
to be owned by %CTI_USER%, and should be permission 0777. 
<br>&nbsp;</li><li>
Create an entry for the machine in the <A href="#ChangeMachine">dTM config file %DTM_HOME%/conf/dTM_conf.xml</a>,
that describes the machine.  (See the <i>README</i> file in that directory.)
The config file entry should include correct values for the OS version
of the machine, number of processors, clock frequency, and should 
include the path to the /dTM (or /tmp/dTM) dir on the machine. Number of processors
and mhz can be obtained by running %DTM_HOME%/bin/get_sys_info.pl when 
logged into the test machine.
<br>&nbsp;</li><li>
Check to make sure that the /tmp and /var/tmp directories are on partitions
that have sufficient space (400-500 mega free, or more).
<br>&nbsp;</li>
Check to make sure that the %CTI_USER% .rhosts file contains the name of
the new machine.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
Update the root contab entry to include the following lines:
<pre><code># Cleanup of /tmp, /var/tmp
25 18 * * * %CTI_HOME%/bin/CTItmpclean.sh
</code></pre>
<p>
This entry is needed in order to prevent /tmp from filling up and
(eventually) causing tests to fail due to lack of disk space. "CTI root dir"
is the root of the CTI installation, e.g. %CTI_HOME% or equivalent.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
Once you are finished with all of the above, add the machine to the pool
with the command described in the following question.
<hr WIDTH="100%">

<a NAME="AddMachine"></a>

<h1>How do I add a machine to a dTM pool or remove it from dTM?</h1>

Note that you have to be %CTI_USER% to add or remove a machine. Note that a machine can
be only shared between non-performance pools, not between the Performance pool and
a non-performance pool.
<BR>
When you have a good entry in the dTM configuration file %DTM_HOME%/conf/dTM_conf.xml for
a machine (if not, you can always <A href="#ChangeMachine">add it to the dTM config file</a> first),
 you can add it to a pool using command
<ol>
<pre><code> %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -addmachine &lt;host_name&gt; -pool &lt;pool_name&gt;
</code></pre>
</ol>
The command will take the machine description from the dTM_conf.xml file and add it
to the specified pool.
When there is no entry for a machine in the dTM_conf.xml file, you can still add it to dTM server.
However if you restart a server, the added machine may be lost and you may need to re-add it.
If the machine description is the same as another machine in a pool (except for the
host name), you can add it with the command
<ol>
<pre><code> %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -addmachine &lt;host_name&gt; -pool &lt;pool_name&gt; -sameas &lt;anothermachine&gt;
</code></pre>
</ol>
Otherwise, you have to add a machine with full description:
<ol>
<pre><code> %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -addmachine &lt;machine_description&gt; -pool &lt;pool_name&gt;
where &lt;machine_description&gt; is in format
  &lt;hostname>:&lt;OS&gt;:&lt;architecture&gt;:&lt;CPU_Implementation&gt;:&lt;Frequency&gt;:&lt;#ofCPU&gt;:&lt;work_dir&gt;:&lt;service&gt;

</code></pre>
</ol>
The newly added machine is disabled. To use it with dTM server, you have to enable it by using <A href="#CmdEnable">dtm enable</a> command.<BR>
To remove a machine from dTM server, disable the machine first, then use command
<ol>
<pre><code> %DTM_HOME%/bin/dtm.pl -rmmachine &lt;host_name&gt;
</code></pre>
</ol>
Note that it will remove the machine from ALL pools in dTM server, if it's disabled and no task is running on it. 
If the removed machine still has an entry in the dTM_conf.xml file, it will re-appear in dTM when you restart dTM server.<br>

<hr WIDTH="100%">


<a NAME="ChangeMachine"></a>

<h1>What should I do if I want to change the dTM configuration file for a test machine?</h1>

If you upgrade the OS, change the number of processors (or make other
alterations to the hardware), relocate the /dTM directory for a dTM test
machine, or add a new machine to dTM, be sure to make changes approperately
to the dTM configuration file %DTM_HOME%/conf/dTM_conf.xml. (See the <i>README</i> file in that directory.) Usually it will take following
steps to change a configuration for a machine:
<ol><pre><code> 1. Disable the machine with <A href="#CmdEnable">dtm -disable</a> command.</li>
 2. Remove the machine from dTM server by <A href="#AddMachine">dtm -rmmachine</a> command.</li>
 3. [OPTIONAL]:Modify the machine description in the %DTM_HOME%/conf/dTM_conf.xml file.</li>
 4. Add it back to a pool by <A href="#AddMachine">dtm -addmachine</a> command.</li>
 5. Enable it by <A href="#CmdEnable">dtm -enable</a> command.</li>
</code></pre></ol>
For step 3, in the %DTM_HOME%/conf/dTM_conf.xml file, there are 9 properties
for each machine:
<ol><PRE><code>
  &lt;machine&gt;
    &lt;host&gt;host_name&lt;/host&gt;
    &lt;os&gt;Linux_SLES11_SP1&lt;/os&gt;
    &lt;arch&gt;x86_64&lt;/arch&gt;
    &lt;impl&gt;AuthenticAMD&lt;/impl&gt;
    &lt;freq&gt;2800&lt;/freq&gt;
    &lt;cpus&gt;8&lt;/cpus&gt; 
    &lt;workdir&gt;/tmp/dTM&lt;/workdir&gt;
    &lt;service&gt;native&lt;/service&gt;
    &lt;service&gt;funcsim&lt;/service&gt;
  &lt;/machine&gt;
</code></PRE></ol>

dTM will query the machine and get these values. You may want to override a 
value, e.g., you want to use 6 CPUs of a 8 CPU machine. For this you will
define the machine like following:
<ol><PRE><code>
  &lt;machine&gt;
    &lt;host&gt;host_name&lt;/host&gt;
    &lt;cpus&gt;6&lt;/cpus&gt; 
  &lt;/machine&gt;
</code></PRE></ol>

<BR>
Then add or remove the machine 
to or from a pool:

<ol><PRE><code>  &lt;pool&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Default&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;host&gt;host_name&lt;/host&gt;
    ... ...
    ... ...
  &lt;/pool&gt;
</code></PRE></ol>

The dTM server can manage one Performance pool and multiple non-performance
pools.
A machine can be only shared between non-performance pools, not between
the Performance pool and a non-performance pool.

<BR>

<hr WIDTH="100%">


<a NAME="NewServer"></a>

<h1>How do I configure a machine to run a dTM server?</h1>
  <ol>
	  <li>Following perl modules are required:
	  <pre>
   1. HTML/Entities.pm
   2. HTTP/Request/Common.pm
   3. LWP/UserAgent.pm
   4. Mail/Internet.pm
   5. Mail/Util.pm
   6. XML/Simple.pm </li>
	  </pre>
	  <li>Make sure at least Java 1.5 is available on the machine.</li>
  </ol>
Once these steps are complete you may start the dTM server on the new machine.


<li>
<p>
For checking the status of jobs on your server, use the following URL:

<p>
<a href="%DTM_WEBHOME%/cgi-bin/dTMState.php?server={CONFIGURE_dtmserver}"> %DTM_WEBHOME%/cgi-bin/dTMState.php?server={CONFIGURE_dtmserver}</a>
</li>

<p>
</ol>

<hr WIDTH="100%">

<a NAME="MachineInfo"></a>

<h1>How should I interpret the CPU/disk numbers displayed for each test machine?</h1>

The dTM status web page shows a row for each test machine. The left-most
box in the row gives some information on the state of the machine itself: host_name, number of CPUs, CPU utilization, and disk utilization. Example:
<ol>
<table BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC"><tr><td><table BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=2 CELLSPACING=2 >
   <tbody> <tr>
   <td ALIGN=CENTER BGCOLOR="#9999CC"> host01 <br> 4 x <font COLOR="green">33%</font><BR>du: <FONT COLOR="green">75%</FONT></td>
   </tr></tbody>
</table></td></tr></table>
</ol>
<p>
The status page obtains number of CPUs, CPU and disk utilization numbers by
connecting to a load daemon on the test machine. CPU utilization
ranges from 0 to 100%; the server will generally not launch jobs onto a
machine whose CPU utilization is less than 25%.  The disk utilization
number reflects the maximum utilization of /dTM, /tmp, and /var/tmp on
the test machine. For example, if /tmp is at 88%, /var/tmp is at 12%,
and /dTM is at 90%, then the number shown will be 90%.  The dTM server
will avoid launching jobs on a machine if its disk utilization metric
goes above 95%.
