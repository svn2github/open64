<H3>Update Known Failures User Guide</H3>

<a name="add"></a>
<H4>Add Failures </H4>

    Four options according to your needs:

    1. Add commented failures, only need to click "Add" button
       at the bottom of the right pane.

    2. Add commented failures & those with same Err Msg(move mouse
       to the test name will display it), choose radio button "ALL 
       SAME ERR MSG", then click "Add"

    3. Add commented failures & those match with the patterns.
       First confirm the pattern string, it should be the most general
       words that all fails you want to add are able to match with it.
       Input the pattern string to text field at the bottom of right pane.
       Then select one of the fails which matches with the pattern and input 
       your comments, choose radio button "ALL ALIKE ERR MSG with PERL 
       Pattern" and click "Add".
       Please note: only one field can be commented, and all those added 
                    fails will have the same comment.
      
    4. Add all fails without Err msg.
       Input "no core dump" to the pattern field, choose "ALL ALIKE ERR MSG 
       with PERL Pattern" and click "Add". They will be added with same 
       comment "no core dump"

<a name="delete"></a>
<H4>Delete Failures </H4>

    Three options according to your needs:

    1. Delete chosen failures, only need to click "Delete" button.
