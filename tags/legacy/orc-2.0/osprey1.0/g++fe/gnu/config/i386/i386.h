/* The purpose of this file is to define the characteristics of the i386,
   independent of assembler syntax or operating system.

   Three other files build on this one to describe a specific assembler syntax:
   bsd386.h, att386.h, and sun386.h.

   The actual tm.h file for a particular system should include
   this file, and then the file for the appropriate assembler syntax.

   Many macros that specify assembler syntax are omitted entirely from
   this file because they really belong in the files for particular
   assemblers.  These include RP, IP, LPREFIX, PUT_OP_SIZE, USE_STAR,
   ADDR_BEG, ADDR_END, PRINT_IREG, PRINT_SCALE, PRINT_B_I_S, and many
   that start with ASM_ or end in ASM_OP.  */

/* An expression giving the cost of an addressing mode that contains
   ADDRESS.  If not defined, the cost is computed from the ADDRESS
   expression and the `CONST_COSTS' values.

   For most CISC machines, the default cost is a good approximation
   of the true cost of the addressing mode.  However, on RISC
   machines, all instructions normally have the same length and
   execution time.  Hence all addresses will have equal costs.

   In cases where more than one form of an address is known, the form
   with the lowest cost will be used.  If multiple forms have the
   same, lowest, cost, the one that is the most complex will be used.

   For example, suppose an address that is equal to the sum of a
   register and a constant is used twice in the same basic block.
   When this macro is not defined, the address will be computed in a
   register and memory references will be indirect through that
   register.  On machines where the cost of the addressing mode
   containing the sum is no higher than that of a simple indirect
   reference, this will produce an additional instruction and
   possibly require an additional register.  Proper specification of
   this macro eliminates this overhead for such machines.

   Similar use of this macro is made in strength reduction of loops.

   ADDRESS need not be valid as an address.  In such a case, the cost
   is not relevant and can be any value; invalid addresses need not be
   assigned a different cost.

   On machines where an address involving more than one register is as
   cheap as an address computation involving only one register,
   defining `ADDRESS_COST' to reflect this can cause two registers to
   be live over a region of code where only one would have been if
   `ADDRESS_COST' were not defined in that manner.  This effect should
   be considered in the definition of this macro.  Equivalent costs
   should probably only be given to addresses with different numbers
   of registers on machines with lots of registers.

   This macro will normally either not be defined or be defined as a
   constant.

   For i386, it is better to use a complex address than let gcc copy
   the address into a reg and make a new pseudo.  But not if the address
   requires to two regs - that would mean more pseudos with longer
   lifetimes.  */

   It is not required that the cost always equal 2 when FROM is the same as TO;
   on some machines it is expensive to move between registers if they are not
   general registers.

   On the i386, copying between floating-point and fixed-point
